# Thompson's Construction in Python

## Introducion
This is my 3rd year project in Graphy Theory.  This is a program written in python turning a regular expression into a NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton) using Thompson's Contruction Algorithm.  This is then used to check if the NFA can be used to match a string against the regular expression.
